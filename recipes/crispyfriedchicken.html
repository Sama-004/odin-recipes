<h2>How to make Crispy Fried Chicken</h2>
  <p>You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this crispy fried chicken:</p>
     <p>Make the Breading
    Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.
    
    Dredge the Chicken
    Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.
    
    Fry the Chicken
    Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>1(4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps for making Crispy Fried Chicken</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer. Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
    <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well. Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!</li>
    <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot. Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides. When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
    <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
